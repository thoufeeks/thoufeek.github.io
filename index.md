## Avoid Starting Conversations with Just “Hello”

### Summary
In modern digital communication, it’s important to respect everyone’s time by being concise and direct. Starting a chat with only “Hello” and waiting for a response before stating your purpose can be inefficient and interruptive. Instead, immediately include your question or topic to facilitate quicker and more productive conversations.

### Effective Chat Practices

#### Inefficient Approach:
```plaintext
2023-09-03 09:15:00 You: Hello
2023-09-03 09:17:30 Colleague: Hi, how can I help you?

COLLEAGUE WAITS FOR YOUR RESPONSE

2023-09-03 09:20:45 You: I’m having trouble with [specific issue]. Could you assist me?
2023-09-03 09:25:10 Colleague: Sure, here’s what you can do…

Efficient Approach:

2023-09-03 09:15:00 You: Hi, I’m encountering an issue with [specific problem]. Could you help me troubleshoot?
2023-09-03 09:17:30 Colleague: Of course, let’s look into it…


Why This Matters:
Saves Time: Jumping straight to the point allows the other person to understand your needs immediately and provide assistance without unnecessary back-and-forth.
Respects Availability: The recipient can respond at their earliest convenience with all the information they need, making asynchronous communication more effective.
Enhances Clarity: Providing context upfront reduces misunderstandings and streamlines the problem-solving process.

Polite and Direct Example:

2023-09-03 09:15:00 You: Good morning! I’m working on [project/task] and ran into [issue]. Do you have a moment to help me out?

This approach remains courteous while efficiently conveying your message.

Appropriate Use of Calls
Initiating calls without prior notice can be disruptive. Here’s how to handle calls respectfully:

Avoid This:

You initiate an unexpected call without prior messaging.

Do This Instead:

2023-09-03 10:00:00 You: Hi, when you have 15 minutes, could we have a quick call to discuss [topic]?


Benefits:
Respects Time: Allows the recipient to prepare and schedule the call at a convenient time.
Provides Context: The recipient knows what to expect and can come prepared for the discussion.
Reduces Interruptions: Minimizes unexpected disruptions to the recipient’s workflow.
